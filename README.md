### Basic Guide
1. You will need to obtain several browser cookies from your current session inside your browser. (requires login)
2. Fill the proper cookies into the source code.
3. Put your EpicNPC thread URLs inside urls.txt.
4. Compile and run the program, it will bump all threads one by one.
5. Don't touch anything, it will close by itself when it's done.
