# EpicNPC Thread Bumper

## Requirements
This requires FireFox to be installed, I personally don't like Chrome. ??

### Basic Guide
1. You will need to obtain several browser cookies from your current session inside your browser. (requires login)
2. Fill the proper cookies into the sourcecode.
3. Put your EpicNPC thread URLs inside urls.txt.
4. Compile and run the program, it will bump all threads one by one.

Sometimes it will end up skipping a thread or throwing an error in the browser, if it happens just run it again.

**Enjoy!**
